<h1> About me</h1>

<p1> I'm Bryce. </p1>

<p1> I'm a hardware designer, with a passion for quantum computers and accelerators. With Moore's law slowing down, new options need explored. I'm excited to devote my career to this. </p1>

<p1> I've become an avid Linux user during college, currently I'm using Manjaro with a Gnome desktop enviroment. I have found Linux to be a great place for me to write quick scripts to solve life's annoying problems. My most recent is a Python based neural network that extracts the totals from scanned receipts. </p1>

<p1> Outside of work I am a happily married man. My wife Kelly and I got married in 2020. We enjoy going outdoors, specifically kayaking. Currently, we are working through Brooklyn 99 together. I'm a big Andy Samberg fan, specifically his role in Hot Rod. She and I also frequent coffee shops a lot, although I am a tea drinker. I've also started to get into autocross. I own a BMW station wagon that I like to prove to my friends that it is indeed a race car. Plus, it's nice to get my hands dirty after work. </p1>
